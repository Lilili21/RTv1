# RTv1
This is a simple ray tracing program. The program parses a 3D scene from an .xml file and applies ray tracing algorithm to render the given scene.
Scene may consist of 4 types of figures(sphere, plane, cone, cylinder) and 2 types of lighting(point, ambient) can be used in a scene.
The program consists of 4 libraries (libXml - files with xml parser, libvec - files with basic vector operations, libSDL - SDL library for macos, libft - basic school42 library used earlier).
Scene examples:
  - Cones
